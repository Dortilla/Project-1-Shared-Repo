    "The main_data_exploration.ipynb notebook aquired data sources and cleaned them up for analysis. This notebook takes the cleaned dataframes and uses them to answer the main hypthesis question: do countries with higher unemployment rate have higher suicide rates? After loading in the data, two functions, one for plotting histograms and the other for scatterplots, are defined. Each function is called on the suicide and unemployment rates data to produce graphics that explain the data. A linear regression is also provided which tested if the to quantities are correlated.\n",

    "The linear regression test resulted in a p-value of 5.55x10^-11 which is much less than alpha = 0.05 meaning the null hypothesis - the slope of country suicide rates vs country unemployment rates is 0 - can be rejected. Specifically this is saying the slope value of 0.21 is significant and discribes the correlation between the two rates. The small r squared value of 0.04 indicates that the data has a high variance and, paricularly, for a given small window of unemployment rates there is a large range of suicide rates associated with such window. The implication is that while the data has positive correlation, the linear eqution is not a great predictor."
